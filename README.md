# Text-summarization-using-LLM
## AIM:  TO explore how LLMs can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of summarizing extensive text data
## Algorithm

### Step1: Import the necessary libraries and load a pre-trained open-source LLM from a repository such as Hugging Face's Transformers.

### Step2: Clean and preprocess the text data to ensure it's in a suitable format for the model (e.g., tokenizing the text, handling special characters).

### Step3: Feed the preprocessed text into the LLM to generate summaries. This typically involves using the modelâ€™s summarization pipeline or relevant functions.

### Step4: Refine and format the generated summaries as needed. This may involve detokenizing the text or adjusting the length and coherence of the summaries.

### Step5: Assess the quality of the summaries using evaluation metrics or human feedback. Optionally, fine-tune the model on specific datasets to improve performance for your use case.
